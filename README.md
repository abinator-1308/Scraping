# Scraping
Amazon used to provide access to product reviews through their Product Advertising API to developers and sellers, a few years back. They discontinued that on November 8, 2010, preventing customers from displaying Amazon reviews about their products, embedded in their websites. As of now, Amazon only returns a link to the review.
